              Hi, we’re NjRescue, and we aim to partner with local New Jersey animal shelters and connect a large network of rescue animals to make adopting a pet easier. If you can’t adopt, no worries! You can donate to help any one of our animals and receive monthly updates on them. We hope to continue to better New Jersey’s adoption rates through our system, and every dog saved is a step towards a brighter future.
